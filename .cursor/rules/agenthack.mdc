Sponsor
Portia is a cutting-edge platform for building controllable AI agents that can plan, ask for user input, and perform complex actions across thousands of tools. Designed with safety, flexibility, and developer experience in mind, Portia enables teams to integrate LLM-powered agents into real-world workflows without compromising on oversight or control.
Portia tackles the core challenges of building practical AI agents through a powerful suite of features including a Controllable Agent Framework that enables structured planning and human-in-the-loop intervention, Tool Connectivity with over 1000+ APIs (like Gmail, GitHub, Slack, and Notion), and Secure Execution through open-source runtimes and configurable policies. Its Developer-Centric SDK allows full customization while ensuring agents behave safely and predictably.
By simplifying how AI agents are created and managed, Portia empowers developers to bring intelligent automation to their workflows safely and reliably.
Judging Criteria
Potential Impact: Evaluates how effectively the agent or solution addresses a meaningful problem or unlocks a valuable use case.
Creativity & Originality: Assesses the uniqueness of the agent idea, the novelty in how tools are connected, or how Portia is used in unexpected ways.
Learning & Growth: Recognizes the learning curve tackled during the hackathon, especially for first-time builders or teams experimenting with AI/automation.
Implementation of the Idea: Reviews how well the idea was executed technically, does the agent function as intended, and does it make good use of Portia's features?
Aesthetics & UX: Considers how intuitive and user-friendly the final experience is, especially if the project has a frontend or user interaction layer.
